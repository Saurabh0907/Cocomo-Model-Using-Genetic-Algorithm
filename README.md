CoCoMo Model
====================================
The Constructive Cost Model (COCOMO) is an algorithmic software cost estimation model developed by Barry W. Boehm. The model uses a basic regression formula with parameters that are derived from historical project data and current as well as future project characteristics.

Genetic Algorithms
====================================
In the computer science field of artificial intelligence, a genetic algorithm (GA) is a search heuristic that mimics the process of natural selection. This heuristic (also sometimes called a metaheuristic) is routinely used to generate useful solutions to optimization and search problems.

Cocomo using GA
====================================
Cocomo model uses coefficients, which were determined in 1981 by means of the regression analysis of statistical data based on 63 different types of project data. Using these coefficients for a modern project, the appraisal may not be accurate; therefore, the aim of this project is to optimize the model coefficients with genetic algorithms.

The project is implemented in Java.
I have used only small test cases.

Basically its the implementation of the following research papers
